# Kata 00-default

You can work from anywhere but I recommend copy 00-default folder into new folder and change name into the kata name. Then run its test file as is:
and work from

```
pnpm run test [name-of-test-file] --watch
```

for example:

```
pnpm run test src/00-default/index.test.ts --watch
```

Test will rerun automatically while you make changes and save index file in this same folder
